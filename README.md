## IT learning


### Basic info:
  Here you may find all kind of stuff related to IT that I have been working on and learning to (except my university files, that are in private repository)

### Directories:
- [C++/DSA](https://github.com/MedrekIT/IT-Learning/tree/59b9b73db337d48fe22ee8c1c932bb935d5160d1/IT%20Learning/programming/C%2B%2B/DSA) |
  [DSA](https://github.com/MedrekIT/IT-Learning/tree/59b9b73db337d48fe22ee8c1c932bb935d5160d1/IT%20Learning/programming/DSA)
  in both of these directories you may find scripts related to DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) some of them I have learnt in online courses/tutorials,
  but mainly these are exercises from book "Algorytmy, struktury danych i techniki programowania" - P. Wróblewski, it might change in the future though.
  Code in the book is provided in C++ language, so I practice them by writing in this language, and then reimplementing in Python.
- [ML](https://github.com/MedrekIT/IT-Learning/tree/59b9b73db337d48fe22ee8c1c932bb935d5160d1/IT%20Learning/programming/ML)
  here are all kinds of Machine Learning algorithms which I mainly aknowledge from book "Machine learning, Python i data science. Wprowadzenie" - A. C. Müller, S. Guido.
  I also have other machine learning books, but I hadn't start reading them yet.
- [Animation](https://github.com/MedrekIT/IT-Learning/tree/59b9b73db337d48fe22ee8c1c932bb935d5160d1/IT%20Learning/programming/animation)
  here are just few small poorly working projects related to animation and physic with GUI implemented in Python.
- [Some Python Stuff](https://github.com/MedrekIT/IT-Learning/tree/59b9b73db337d48fe22ee8c1c932bb935d5160d1/IT%20Learning/programming/some%20python%20stuff)
  most of my projects are mainly here, and I would say these are more advanced than those in the other directories.
  Although some of them are small or unfinished, there are a few good projects like
  [Snake](https://github.com/MedrekIT/IT-Learning/tree/a8fa1a65e50368d639a56df3df3e797b25fe0a43/IT%20Learning/programming/some%20python%20stuff/games/snake) or
  [Sorting algorithms visualisation](https://github.com/MedrekIT/IT-Learning/tree/a8fa1a65e50368d639a56df3df3e797b25fe0a43/IT%20Learning/programming/some%20python%20stuff/visual%20stuff/sorting%20algorithms).
  I also test here some of my LeetCode problems solutions.
